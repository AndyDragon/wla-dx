WLA Flags
=========

Here are short descriptions for the flags you can give to WLA:

You can supply WLA with some (or all or none) of the following option flags.

-d  Disable WLA's ability to calculate A-B where A and B are labels
-h  Assume that all label references are 16-bit by default (size hints
    still work). Without this flag it's assumed that label references are
    8-bit unless otherwise specified.
-i  Add list file information. Adds extra information to the output so
    WLALINK can produce list files.
-k  Keep all empty sections. By default they are discarded.
-M  WLA generates makefile rules describing the dependencies of the main
    source file.
-MP Create a phony target for each dependency other than the main file,
    use this with -M.
-q  Quiet mode. ``.PRINT*`` -directives output nothing.
-s  Don't create _sizeof_* and _padding_* definitions.
-t  Test assemble. Doesn't output any files.
-v  Verbose mode. Shows a lot of information about the compiling process.
-v1 Verbose messages (only discard sections)
-v2 Verbose messages (-v1 plus short summary)
-x  Extra compile time labels and definitions. WLA does extra work by creating
    few helpful definitions, and labels SECTIONSTART_[section name] and
    SECTIONEND_[section name] at the beginning and end of a section.
-D  Declare a definition.
    
One (and only one) of the following command flags must be defined.

-l  Output a library file.
-o  Output an object file.

You may also use an extra option to specify the include directory. WLA will
search this directory for included files before defaulting to the specified
``.INCDIR`` or current working directory.

-I  Directory to include files.

Examples::

    [seravy@localhost tbp]# wla -D VERSION=255 -x -v -i -o testa.o testa.s
    [seravy@localhost tbp]# wla -M testa.s
    [seravy@localhost tbp]# wla -D VERSION=$FF -D MESSAGE=\"Hello world\" -l testb.lib testb.s
    [seravy@localhost tbp]# wla -I ../../include -l testb.lib testb.s
    [seravy@localhost tbp]# wla -M -I myfiles -l testa.lib testa.s
    
NOTE: If you use -M and -l/-o at the same time, specify -M first on the command line.
    
NOTE: The first example produces a file named ``testa.o``.
