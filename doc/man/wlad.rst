   (sub)sections UNLESS there is a !(sub)section defined. Luckly, that
   !(sub)section is invisible in the manpage.

Manpage: WLAD
=============


SYNOPSIS
--------

| ``wlad`` [``OPTIONS``] ``BIN_FILE``


OPTIONS
-------

-a  Disable address output
-d  Upper banks (1->) are disassembled as data (Can not be used with ``-s``)
-s  Upper banks (1->) are disassembled as data with string detection enabled
    (Can not be used with ``-d``)


DESCRIPTION
-----------

**WARNING**: WLAD is not being maintained any longer, and no plans regarding it
have been made.

WLAD is a disassembler that can be used to disassemble an existing GB-ROM
image into a WLA-syntax compatible source file. It won't produce very readable
code as all the labels etc. are discarded in the last phase of linking when
the ROM image is made. In the current state WLAD doesn't generate labels,
but it will in the future.

Give it the binary file (usually the extension is ``.gb`` or ``.cgb``) and
WLAD will output the source code into stdout (the shell you are using).

Use ``-s`` if you intend to change texts in games.
The flags ``-d`` and ``-s`` cannot be used at the same time.

WLAD supports both normal GB-ROMs and Pocket Voiceâ„¢ ROM images.
Only WLAD GB-Z80 exists curently.


EXAMPLES
--------

::

    wlad tbp.cgb > tbp.s
    wlad -da parallax.gb > parallax.s
    wlad -s parallax.gb > parallax.s
