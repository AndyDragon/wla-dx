Good things to know about WLA
=============================

- Is 255 (Amiga, MSDOS) or 1023 (other platforms) bytes too little for a
  string (file names, labels, definition labels, etc)? Check out
  ``MAX_NAME_LENGTH`` in ``shared.h``.
- Want to have more operators and operands in a calculation than 64 (Amiga,
  MSDOS) or 256 (other platforms)? Check out ``MAX_STACK_CALCULATOR_ITEMS``
  in ``defines.h``.
- WLA preprocessor doesn't expand macros and repetitions. Those are actually
  traversed in the assembling phase.
- WLA's source code is mainly a huge mess, but WLALINK is quite well
  structured and written. So beware!
- To get the length of a string e.g. "peasoup", write "peasoup".length.
- Do not write ``.E`` into your sources as WLA uses it internally to mark
  the end of a file.
